## Quant Indicator™

</div>

TradingView Quant Indicator is our first AI-powered indicator for market analysis directly on the chart. Quant processes live market data together with price action, liquidity, positioning, volatility, market structure, and scheduled events. It uses this information to model several ways the market may develop over the selected timeframe and updates its analysis as new data becomes available.

Quant is currently in beta. Early access is available through GitHub while we continue testing the indicator, improving calculation stability, and refining its behavior across different market conditions.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install the Quant Indicator using Command Prompt.

#### 1. Open Command Prompt.

Press **Win + R**, type:

```text

```

Then press **Enter**.

#### 2. Install the Quant Indicator.

```
